Deep research shortlist: choosing seven stocks
from your screenshots
Scope and important caveats
You asked for a research-based way to select  7 companies  from the two screenshots (24 companies
total) and to explain both : why the seven were chosen, and why the others were not.
This is general investment research , not personal financial advice. The right shortlist depends on your
full situation (emergency fund, debt, time horizon, job stability, whether you already hold broad ETFs,
etc.). Where I make judgement calls (for example, “too cyclical” or “too much regulatory risk”), those are
risk-management preferences —not predictions.
Because you’re investing from Australia  into mostly US-listed equities, your result in A$ can be
meaningfully affected by currency movements  (AUD/USD can amplify or reduce returns).  If you
hold US stocks that pay dividends, the common workflow for many brokers is to use a W‑8BEN so that
dividend withholding reflects the treaty rate (often discussed as 15%  for Australian tax residents when
properly documented, instead of a default higher rate). 
Selection framework and market context
I screened the 24 companies using a “ core-growth shortlist ” lens—aiming for a set of seven that can
be held for years with a sensible balance of:
Durable business models  with clear customer value and evidence of execution (financial results,
backlog/order visibility, repeatable economics).
Profitability and cash generation  (or a credible path to it that’s already visible in reported
numbers).
Diversification of drivers  (so one single policy decision, single product, or a single country/
regulatory environment is less likely to dominate outcomes).
Avoiding “binary” risk  where one event can halve the investment (common in single-asset
biopharma, catastrophe-heavy insurers, or geopolitically sensitive ADRs).
Diversification does not eliminate risk, but it can reduce idiosyncratic risk  (the risk of a single company
blowing up the portfolio). 
Seven stocks selected and rationale
Below are the seven I would prioritise  from your list , with emphasis on  recent trend ,  multi-year
operating performance , and “what would have to stay true” for the thesis to work.
Comfort Systems USA  (FIX)
This is a mechanical and electrical contracting business (HVAC and related services) that has recently
shown unusually strong operating momentum and backlog expansion. In full-year 2025 it reported
$9.10bn revenue  (up from $7.03bn in 2024) and $1.02bn net income  (up from $522m), with operating1

cash  flow  also  above  $1bn.   The  most  important  “trend”  metric  here  is  backlog :  it  reported
$11.94bn  backlog  at  31  Dec  2025  versus  $5.99bn  a  year  earlier  (same-store  backlog  $11.58bn  vs
$5.99bn).  That backlog surge indicates unusually strong near-term demand visibility (though it can
still be cyclical). Market commentary in early 2026 frames much of the strength as tied to the build-out
of AI/data-centre and related infrastructure, which has helped several “picks-and-shovels” contractors
outperform. 
Why it made the cut: among your industrial names, this has one of the clearest “evidence-based”
demand signals (backlog + cash flow + profit expansion). 
Kinsale Capital  (KNSL)
This is a property & casualty insurer focused exclusively on the US excess and surplus (E&S)  market
(hard-to-place risks, placed via brokers).  In 2025 it reported $503.6m net income  (vs $414.8m in
2024),  $1.6bn net written premiums  (up 9.4%), and a  75.9% combined ratio  for the year (71.7% in
Q4).   A combined ratio below 100% is widely used to indicate underwriting profitability (before
investment income). 
Why it made the cut: in your insurance cluster , this appears “best-in-class” on underwriting profitability
metrics and has a clearly defined niche (E&S) described in its filings.   The main watch-out is that
competition  and  pricing  conditions  can  change  over  cycles  (noted  in  its  own  disclosures  and
commentary). 
Monolithic Power Systems  (MPWR)
This is a power-semiconductor company focused on energy-efficient power management solutions. 
For 2025 it reported $2.8bn revenue , up 26.4%  versus 2024, with gross margin roughly mid‑55%  and
materially higher operating income versus 2024.  The company has been explicitly associated with
power-control  modules  used  in  AI/data-centre  build-outs  in  prior  reporting  and  coverage,  and
management’s commentary shows end-market growth across multiple verticals (reducing single-market
dependence). 
Why it made the cut: among your “tech-ish” names, this one combines (a) a clear product category with
structural tailwinds (power efficiency), and (b) strong, recent full-year growth shown in the company’s
own earnings materials. 
First Solar  (FSLR)
This is a US-headquartered solar technology and manufacturing company, positioned as a domestic
manufacturing alternative in utility-scale solar .   In Q3 2025 it reported  $1.6bn net sales , record
volume sold (5.3 GW), and a contracted sales backlog of 53.7 GW  valued at $16.4bn  (as of 30 Sept 2025),
alongside a  net cash  position cited at  $1.5bn .   The key “trend” indicator is that backlog/booking
engine—because it drives multi-year revenue visibility in a manufacturing business. But it has also
shown that backlog can change: Reuters reported it lowered full-year sales/volume guidance due to
reduced  international  volumes  and  customer  terminations,  and  noted  backlog  reduction  tied  to  a
contract dispute (including litigation context). 
Why it made the cut: it gives your shortlist exposure to an energy transition theme with unusually
visible order-book disclosures, while reported liquidity appears strong relative to many cyclicals. 
Halozyme Therapeutics  (HALO)
This one is structurally different from “single drug” biotechs. It commercialises and licenses an enzyme-
based drug delivery platform (ENHANZE/rHuPH20) that enables subcutaneous delivery and generates
royalty revenue tied to partner product sales.  In full-year 2025 it reported $1.397bn total revenue
(+38% YoY) and $868m royalty revenue  (+52% YoY), and reiterated 2026 guidance for $1.71–$1.81bn
revenue  and $1.13–$1.17bn royalties . 
Why it made the cut: among your healthcare names, this has a more “platform/royalty” profile (multiple6

products/partners  can  contribute)  rather  than  being  dominated  by  a  single  clinical  readout.  The
company’s own guidance frames continued growth driven by ENHANZE royalties. 
UFP Technologies  (UFPT)
This is a contract development and manufacturing organisation (CDMO) specialising in  single-use /
single-patient medical devices  and components—a part of the medtech supply chain that can benefit
from outsourcing and programme wins (including robotic surgery components).   In Q3 2025 it
reported  $154.6m sales  (up from $145.2m), and year-to-date sales  $453.9m  (up from $360.4m), with
commentary  pointing  to  programme  transfers,  robotic-surgery  launches  expected  to  drive  2026
revenue, and an acquisition-led expansion strategy. 
Why it made the cut: it diversifies your shortlist away from pure “macro” cyclicals and away from binary
biotech  risk,  while  still  showing  strong  recent  revenue  momentum  and  a  defined  pipeline  of
programme ramps (a tangible “trend” to monitor quarter to quarter). 
Powell Industries  (POWL)
This is an electrical equipment and systems company focused on the management/control/distribution
of electrical energy—exposed to grid, industrial electrification, and reliability upgrades.   In fiscal
2025 it reported $1.1bn revenue  (+9%), $181m net income  (+21%), and $1.4bn backlog  at year end
(Sept  30,  2025),  plus  strong  gross  margin  levels  (~29%  for  the  year).   Management  explicitly
highlighted encouraging customer activity in the data-centre  market as opportunities grow in size and
volume, which is notable because it connects the company’s offering to a powerful capex cycle beyond
traditional oil & gas.   Subsequent filings also referenced backlog increases into late 2025 (record
backlog cited as of Dec 31, 2025 in an 8‑K excerpted source). 
Why it made the cut: within your industrial set, this offers a credible “electrification + infrastructure
capex” angle with strong recent profitability and backlog support, while still being understandable and
monitorable through orders/backlog disclosures. 
Why the other stocks were not selected
The following companies can still succeed, but they did not make the “top seven” for a  core-growth
shortlist  because their risk profiles are (in my view) either more binary , more geopolitically exposed , 
more  catastrophe‑tailed ,  or  more  dependent  on  one  variable  (commodity  pricing,  licensing
catch‑ups, one product).
China ADR and regulatory/geopolitical exposure
Full Truck Alliance  reported Q3 2025 revenue growth (RMB3,358m total net revenues, +10.8% YoY)
driven  by  transaction  services,  but  this  is  still  a  China-based  platform  business  with  governance/
geopolitical layers that can matter for foreign holders; Reuters has also reported discussion of a second
listing outside the US as part of risk management.   Kanzhun  (BOSS Zhipin) posted Q3 2025
revenue growth (RMB2,163m, +13.2% YoY), but it shares the broader “China platform” risk bucket where
regulatory  and  macro  conditions  can  dominate  equity  outcomes.   China  is  central  to  both
theses, which increases single-country exposure. 
High-beta consumer-credit fintech
NU Holdings  is operationally impressive (Q3 2025: 127m customers; >$4bn revenue; $783m net
income) and has been framed by Reuters as producing record profitability and strong ROE, but it
remains materially exposed to credit cycles, funding conditions, and macro/currency dynamics typical of
consumer lending.  Sezzle  has shown very rapid growth and improving profitability in reported
periods (for example, revenue growth and EBITDA expansion cited in an earnings summary), but BNPL
models are typically more sensitive to consumer stress and competitive pricing pressure, which makes25

it higher-volatility than what I would put into a “core seven” unless you explicitly want a high-risk/high-
upside allocation. 
Additional insurers where risk concentration is harder to justify versus one “best-in-class” pick
Palomar  delivered very strong 2025 profitability and premium growth (for example, 2025 gross
written  premiums  $2.0bn  and  combined  ratio  76.9%),  but  parts  of  its  book  relate  to  catastrophe-
sensitive specialty property lines that can produce “tail risk” outcomes.  Skyward Specialty Insurance
Group  showed Q4 2025 revenue growth and a combined ratio around 88.5% in a widely circulated
metrics recap, but it has a shorter public-market operating history than the top pick in this space and
therefore  less  “through-cycle”  evidence.   Hamilton  Insurance  Group  reported  record  2025
earnings  with  a  92.9%  combined  ratio  and  strong  book  value  growth,  but  reinsurance  and  global
specialty property books can be more exposed to large-loss years than E&S small commercial focus. 
HCI Group  is explicitly Florida-based in its core insurance activity per its filing, which increases
hurricane/regulatory concentration (even with reinsurance). 
Single-product or binary-event biopharma risk
Krystal Biotech  has shown strong commercial traction (with full-year 2025 revenue reported at
~$389m in a recent summary and filings emphasising dependence on VYJUVEK cash generation), but
this remains closer to a “single franchise” risk profile than the platform/royalty structure of my selected
name.   Catalyst  Pharmaceuticals  has  grown  revenues  across  product  lines  (annual  report
discusses growth drivers including AGAMREE commercialisation and FIRDAPSE growth), yet company
filings have also indicated that product revenue concentration is a key feature of the model—still more
idiosyncratic than I want for a core seven.  Harmony Biosciences  disclosed in its 10‑K that 2024
net product revenue related to WAKIX was $714.7m—again highlighting that one product is central
even as the pipeline expands.   Corcept Therapeutics  shows why binary risk matters: Reuters
reported the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  declined to approve relacorilant for a Cushing-
related indication at the end of 2025, driving a very sharp share price move, while filings also stress
dependence on Korlym revenue. 
Commodity/food businesses where one external variable dominates outcomes
Cal-Maine Foods  produced extraordinary fiscal 2025 profits (net income ~$1.2bn) driven largely by
egg  pricing  and  demand,  but  it  has  also  confirmed  a  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  antitrust
investigation into egg price increases—these are not the kinds of “steady compounding” characteristics
I prioritise for a core seven.   Vital Farms  has built a strong brand and exceeded $600m net
revenue in 2024 with a stated $1bn sales target by 2027, but it disclosed a  material weakness  in
internal controls in its 2024 annual report and has also navigated tariff/cost-related pricing pressures—
governance plus margin sensitivity pushed it outside the top list for now. 
Business-model complexity or lumpy revenue recognition
Hamilton Lane  reported fiscal 2025 results including $138bn AUM and growth in management and
advisory fees, but the Financial Times has scrutinised aspects of the firm’s private-assets fund valuation
practices and fee structure changes (“NAV squeezing”/unrealised gains), which increases complexity and
reputational/governance risk for a simple seven-stock basket.   InterDigital  explicitly derives
revenue primarily from licensing patented innovations, and its reported results can include “catch-up”
revenue,  which  makes  forecasting  more  idiosyncratic  than  operating  businesses  with  steady  unit
economics.  Argan  has meaningful backlog disclosures (over $1.3bn backlog at Jan 31, 2025) and
large project wins, but EPC/project businesses are inherently lumpy and can be sensitive to project
timing and execution in ways that can surprise investors. 42
